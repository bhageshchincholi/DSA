//Write all possibilites to check palindrome. Also do time and space complexity analysis.

/**
 * 1) enter a one palindrome 
 * 2) Traverse the string from both ends
 * 3) after that compare both string at both ends of characters 
 * 4) Time Complexity Analysis : 
 * here we search at the end of string which means until last element  --> O(n)
 * 5) Space Complexity Analysis : 
 * here we use string,int size, int i ---> S(n) = O(3)  ---> O(1)
